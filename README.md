## simOMPP

simOMPP stands for Simulation - Optical Mapping Post Processing. Here you can find a collection of Python scripts for post-processing Electra simulations results and MatLab action potential durations and activation times from optical mappings.


# Glossary
 
* AT activation time
* APD action potential duration
* CV conduction velocity
* RT repolarization time


### Features

* Compute APDs from Electra simulation results (.ens files) or from OMap's filtered signals (.mat)   
* Get plots of ATs and APDs from OMap
* Generate .vtk for visualization on paraview of RTs, ATs, CVs and APDs
* Interpolate data on mesh as ATs
* Also you can find some utilities for post processing the aforementioned files.


### Installation

1. Install Python 3.X and install all dependencies using pip or conda
2. [Optional] It is recommended to use VS code.
3. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
4. Try the code



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Every script receives a group of arguments, the specific information for these arguments is in the code, READ IT carefully.
You can run
   ```sh
   /path-to-script/script.py --help 
   ```
In order to see the arguments needed it and what they do
